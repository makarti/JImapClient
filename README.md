Imap client viewer
 Hello guys! This simple application for viewer messages from some accounts into the one window.
 If you want to try this project you have to add some libraries as sqlite4java(sqlite https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/) and javamail (imap pop3 client https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home)
 I also use SWT interface for GUI in Eclipse.
 Good luck!
